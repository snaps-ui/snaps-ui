## Architecture

Snaps UI is built with **flexibility and reusability** in mind. It provides production-ready components powered by a lightweight core, while keeping styling and customization fully in your control.

### Filing Issues

- If it’s a **styling or design issue**, you can usually fix it directly in the Snaps UI codebase and submit a PR.

### Feature Requests

- If the feature is a **new component**, start a discussion in the [Snaps UI repository](https://github.com/snaps-ui/snaps-ui).
