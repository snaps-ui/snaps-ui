title: Client Only
description: Usad to render content only on the client side
---

The ClientOnly component renders its children only on the client side. This is useful for components
that need to access the DOM or browser APIs that are not available on the server side.

## Usage

```tsx
import { ClientOnly } from '@snaps-ui/react'
;<ClientOnly>Hey, running on client only.</ClientOnly>
```

## Examples

### Basic

<ExampleTabs name="client-only-basics" scope="client-only" />

### With Fallback

<ExampleTabs name="client-only-fallback" scope="client-only" />

## Props

| Prop       | Type        | Default | Description                                                           |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | â€”       | The content to render once the component is mounted on the client.    |
| `fallback` | `ReactNode` | `null`  | The content to render on the server or before the client has mounted. |
