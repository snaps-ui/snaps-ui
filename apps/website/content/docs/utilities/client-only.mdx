The ClientOnly component renders its children only on the client side. This is useful for components
that need to access the DOM or browser APIs that are not available on the server side.

## Usage

```tsx
import { ClientOnly } from '@snaps-ui/react'

;<ClientOnly>Hey, running on client only.</ClientOnly>
```

## Examples

### Basic

<ExampleTabs name="client-only-basics" scope="client-only" />

### With Fallback

<ExampleTabs name="client-only-fallback" scope="client-only" />
