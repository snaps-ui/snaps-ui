<ExampleTabs name="typography-basics" scope="typography" />

## Usage

```tsx
import { Typography } from '@snaps-ui/react'

export const Example = () => (
  <>
    <Typography variant="h1">Heading 1</Typography>
    <Typography variant="h2">Heading 2</Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1">Body text goes here.</Typography>
  </>
)
```

The **Typography** component provides predefined text styles such as headings, body text,
captions, and more, ensuring a consistent reading experience across your app.

## Gutter Bottom

Use the **gutterBottom** prop to add consistent spacing below the text:

```tsx
<Typography variant="h4" gutterBottom>
  Section Title
</Typography>
<Typography variant="body1">
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
</Typography>
```

## Customizing the Element

You can override the rendered element using the **as** prop:

```tsx
<Typography variant="body1" as="span">
  Inline text
</Typography>
```

This allows for more flexibility when using Typography inside other components.

## Example with Different Variants

<ExampleTabs name="typography-with-variants" scope="typography" />

## Accessibility

**Typography** automatically maps semantic HTML elements (h1, p, span, etc.) based on the variant.
You can override this behavior using the as prop for improved accessibility in specific layouts.
